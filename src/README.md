[Pico-debug](https://github.com/majbthrd/pico-debug) is an open-source project which turns one Cortex-M0+ core in RP2040 into a CMSIS-DAP adapter. It means that without an extra one, you can debug a Pico in MDK with just one USB connector. In order to do so, [download the latest uf2 file](https://github.com/majbthrd/pico-debug/releases) first.
